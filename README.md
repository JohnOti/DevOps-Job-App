# Getting Started with DevOps Job App
This project is all about an app that showcases available developer jobs across the world.  
I deployed my json server using **herokuapp**.  
## API USED
--To keep the data persisting, a REST API is used.   **[DB.JSON](https://devops-job-app.herokuapp.com/jobs)**

## MVPS
--It allowws the user to search for the jobs depending on location or the job title.  
--The user can also filter jobs by category or location.  
--The user can also add to the job listing page any developer job that is available.
